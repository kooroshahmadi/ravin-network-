Physical Security in CyberSecurity:
Key Use Cases of SIEM in Cybersecurity:
	Physical security:
		refers to measures designed to protect physical assets such as servers, networking equipment, data centers, employees, and printed information from unauthorized access, theft, destruction, or natural disasters.
	Without proper physical protection, even the most secure digital systems can be compromised.
	Common Physical Security Threats:
		Theft of devices or data.
		Sabotage by internal or external actors.
		Unauthorized access to server rooms.
		Fire or natural disasters.
		Power outages or voltage surges.


Multi-Layered Physical Security:
	To ensure effective protection, organizations implement multi-Layered physical security. each layer adds an additional barrier to prevent unauthorized access.
	Key Layers of Physical Security:
		Perimeter Layer:
			Protects the outer boundary with fences, gates, lighting, and external cameras.
		Access Control Layer:
			Uses smart cards, biometric scanners, or PIN codes to grant entry to secured areas.
		Inner Layer:
			Includes locks on server racks, equipment cages, and physical safeguards for sensitive hardware.
		Monitoring & Alert Layer:
			Incorporates CCTV, motion detectors, door alarms, and 24/7 surveillance.


Physical Security Controls in Organizations:
	Physical security includes preventive, detective, and responsive controls. these controls must work together to ensure proper protection of assets.
	Types of physical Security controls:
		Locked doors, access cards, fences, adn security guards.
	Detective Controls:
		CCTV systems, motion detectors, and alarm sensors.
	Responsive Controls:
		Audible alarms, response teams, automated emergency calls to law enforcement.


Common Physical Security Threats:
	physical security is exposed to multiple threats, often caused by human error, environmental factors, or technical failures.
		Unauthorized access to network infrastructure.
		Data theft via physical access to servers or devices.
		Equipment damage due to fire, food, or power surges.
		 Business disruption through physical sabotage or attacks.
		 Unattended devices (e.g., unprotected laptops).
