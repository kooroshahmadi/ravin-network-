SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):
	SIEM is a combination of:
		SIM (Security Information Management): log collection and storage.
		SEM (Security Event Management): real-time event analysis and correlation.
	Purpose of SIEM:
		Aggregate logs from diverse sources.
		Analyze, correlate, and generate alerts.
		Enable visibility across the infrastructure.
		Support compliance and forensics.
	SIEM is the brain and eyes of the Security  Operations Center (SoC):
		it helps detect threats like internal misuse, external intrusions, and compliance violations.
	Example:
		SIEM receives logs from a firewall, a Windows server, and antivirus software. it detects:
			Multiple failed login attempts form the same IP.
			Antivirus detection of a suspicious script.
				SIEM correlates the events and raises an alert for a potential brute-force or lateral movement attack.
