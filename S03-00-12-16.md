SSH:
	Secure Shell
	TCP/22
	a hostname and a domain name must be configed for this to work
	SW1(config)# ip domain-name cisco.com
	FQDN:
		Fully Qualified Domain Name => the combination of a hostname and a domain name is called FQDN (Gemini add an example)
	now we need a crypto key:
		SW1(config)# crypto key generate rsa (Gemini add a description on RSA)
		the name for the key will be the FQDN.
		now you will be prompted to select how many bits you want in a module and for SSH v2 you need more than 768 bits.
		in the end a non exportable key will be created.
Gemini add a step by step guide on how to connect to a server using SSH and fill in the gaps that i have

VLAN:
	Gemini add an explanation of VLAN.
	when creating VLAN's you have to choose a VLAN ID, this ID is between 1 - 4094 (expect 1, and 1055)

TRUNK:
	IEEE 802.1Q
