	Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or device. it ensures that the person or system is who they claim to be. this can be done through:
		Passwords
		Smart cards
		Biometric data
			Example: Logging into a system with username and password.
What is Access Control:
	Access Control defines what users are allowed to do once authenticated. it restricts access to systems, files, and functions based on roles or permissions.
