 Authentication and Access Control:

what is Authentication?
	Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or device. it ensures that the person or system is who they claim to be. this can be done through:
		Passwords
		Smart cards
		Biometric data
			Example: Logging into a system with username and password.
What is Access Control:
	Access Control defines what users are allowed to do once authenticated. it restricts access to systems, files, and functions based on roles or permissions.
		Example: only the finance team can edit budget spreadsheets.
Difference Between Authentication and Authorization:
Concept, Question Answered, Purpose
Authentication, Who are you?, identity verification
Authorization, what are you allowed to do, grants or restricts permissions.

Security Filtering:
	Access Control Lists (ACLs)
	ACLs are sules applied to router or switch interfaces that define whether packets are permitted or denied based on:
		Source IP address
		Destination IP address
		Protocol or port numbers
	Types:
		Standard ACl: Filters by source IP only.
		Extended ACL: Filters by source, destionation, protocol, and port.
	Tunneling:
		Tunneling is the process of encapsulation traffic in a secure wrapper for transmission over insecure networks.
		Used in VPNs (GRE, IPsec, L2TP).
	Encryption:
		Encryption ensures confidentiality of data in transit or at rest.
		Symmetric (e.g., A)
