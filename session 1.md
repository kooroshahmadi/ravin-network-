Ethernet:
	Definition: all networks that are based on twisted pair or fiber optic cables.
	IEEE 802.3
	Cisco's Ethernet switches and two models, fix and modular:
		fix: the number of ports on the switch is fixed and cannot be changed.
		modular: the ports on the switch can be changed using moduls that will slide in the device.
	Port Types:
		FastEthernet 0/0
		FastEthernet 0/1
		GigabitEthernet 0/0
		GigabitEthernet 1/0/1
		TenGigabitEthernet 1/1
		module => Interface TYPE Module Number/Interface number
	Switch:
		Layer2
		Layer3 => MLS (MultiLayer Switch)
	Switch Responsibility:
		Is to forward frames between devices.
		a Switch will decide its actions based on its MAC Address Table.
		a Switch will forward frames based on destination MAC address.
