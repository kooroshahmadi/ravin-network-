# Physical Access Control Methods

Mechanisms to control who goes where.

### 1. The Mantrap (Access Control Vestibule)
*   **Definition:** A small room with two doors. The first door must close and lock before the second door opens.
*   **Purpose:** Prevents **Tailgating** (Piggybacking) – where an unauthorized person follows an authorized person through a door.
*   **Use Case:** Entry to high-security Server Rooms or Data Centers.

### 2. Biometrics (Something You Are)
*   **Types:** Fingerprint, Retina (Blood vessels), Iris (Pattern), Facial Recognition.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   **FRR (False Rejection Rate):** The system denies a valid user (Annoying).
    *   **FAR (False Acceptance Rate):** The system lets in a hacker (Dangerous).

### 3. Hardware Locks
*   **Cable Locks:** Securing laptops to desks.
*   **USB Locks:** Physical plugs that stop people from inserting USB drives to steal data.
*   **Faraday Cage:** A mesh enclosure that blocks electromagnetic signals (Wi-Fi/Cellular) to prevent remote hacking.
