# Wireless Threats

### 1. Rogue Access Point
*   **Definition:** An unauthorized device plugged into the wired network.
*   **Scenario:** An employee brings a cheap router from home and plugs it into the office wall jack because they want better Wi-Fi in the breakroom.
*   **Risk:** It creates a **Backdoor** into the secure network that bypasses the company firewall.

### 2. Evil Twin
*   **Definition:** A malicious AP that **impersonates** a legitimate one.
*   **Scenario:** The hacker sets up a hotspot named "Starbucks Wi-Fi." You connect to it thinking it's real. The hacker now sees all your traffic.
*   **Key Diff:** Rogue AP = Unauthorized Hardware. Evil Twin = Identity Theft (SSID Spoofing).

### 3. Wardriving
*   **Definition:** Driving around with an antenna to map out vulnerable Wi-Fi networks.
