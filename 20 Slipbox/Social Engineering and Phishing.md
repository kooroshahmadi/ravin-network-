# Social Engineering and Phishing

Attacking the **Human** instead of the machine.

### Phishing Types
1.  **Phishing:** Sending mass generic emails (e.g., "Reset your Netflix password") to steal credentials.
2.  **Spear Phishing:** Targeting a **specific** individual or company (e.g., "Hi Bob, this is Alice from HR...").
3.  **Whaling:** Targeting a high-profile executive (CEO/CFO).
4.  **Vishing:** Voice Phishing (Phone scams).
5.  **Smishing:** SMS/Text Phishing.

### Typosquatting (URL Hijacking)
*   **Concept:** Using a URL that looks like the real one but has a typo.
*   **Example:** `rnicrosoft.com` (using 'r' and 'n' to look like 'm') or `goggle.com`.
