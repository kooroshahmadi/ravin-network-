# Exploits vs. Vulnerabilities

Understanding the difference between the "Open Door" and the "Key."

### 1. Vulnerability (The Weakness)
*   **Definition:** A flaw or weakness in hardware, software, or procedures that *could* be triggered to cause harm.
*   **Analogy:** Leaving your house window unlocked.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Unpatched Windows 10.
    *   Weak password ("admin/admin").
    *   SQL Injection flaw in a website.
*   **Identification:** Found using **Vulnerability Scanners** (e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS).

### 2. Exploit (The Tool)
*   **Definition:** The specific code, software, or technique used to *take advantage* of a vulnerability.
*   **Analogy:** The specific skill required to climb through that unlocked window.
*   **Examples:**
    *   A Python script that crashes the server.
    *   A Buffer Overflow attack string.
*   **Framework:** **Metasploit** is a common tool for running exploits.

### 3. Zero-Day
*   **Definition:** A vulnerability that the vendor (Microsoft/Apple) **does not know about yet**. There is "Zero Days" time to fix it before hackers use it. These are the most dangerous.
