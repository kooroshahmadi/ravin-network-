# 802.11 Wireless Standards

**IEEE 802.11** is the set of standards that defines how Wireless LANs (WLANs) operate. These standards dictate speed, frequency, and range.

### The Evolution of Wi-Fi

| Standard | Wi-Fi Gen | Frequencies | Max Data Rate | Key Feature |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **802.11a** | Legacy | 5 GHz | 54 Mbps | First 5GHz standard. Fast but short range. |
| **802.11b** | Legacy | 2.4 GHz | 11 Mbps | First popular standard. Long range, slow, interference-prone. |
| **802.11g** | Legacy | 2.4 GHz | 54 Mbps | Backwards compatible with 'b' but faster. |
| **802.11n** | **Wi-Fi 4** | 2.4 / 5 GHz | 600 Mbps | **MIMO** (Multiple antennas) introduced. |
| **802.11ac** | **Wi-Fi 5** | 5 GHz | ~6.9 Gbps | **MU-MIMO** (Multi-User) and wider channels. |
| **802.11ax** | **Wi-Fi 6** | 2.4 / 5 / 6 GHz | ~9.6 Gbps | **OFDMA** (Efficiency in crowded areas like stadiums). |

### Frequency Differences
*   **2.4 GHz:** Long range, passes through walls well. **High interference** (microwaves, Bluetooth use this).
*   **5 GHz:** Faster speeds, shorter range. Harder to pass through solid walls.
*   **6 GHz (Wi-Fi 6E):** Massive bandwidth, very low interference, short range.
