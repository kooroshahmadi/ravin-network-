# Network Connectors and Transceivers

### Copper Connectors
*   **RJ-11:** 4-6 pins. Used for **Telephone** and DSL.
*   **RJ-45:** 8 pins. Used for **Ethernet**.
*   **F-Type:** Screw-on connector for Coaxial (Cable TV/Modems).

### Fiber Transceivers (The Interface)
You cannot plug a raw fiber cable into a switch. You plug the fiber into a **Transceiver**, and plug the Transceiver into the switch.
*   **SFP (Small Form-factor Pluggable):** Supports 1 Gbps.
*   **SFP+:** Supports 10 Gbps (Same size as SFP).
*   **QSFP (Quad SFP):** Supports 40 Gbps (Four channels combined).

> [!tip] BiDi Transceivers
> Bi-Directional transceivers can send and receive data on a *single* fiber strand by using different colors (wavelengths) of light for Tx and Rx.
