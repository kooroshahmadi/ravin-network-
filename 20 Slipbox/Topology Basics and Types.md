# Topology Basics

**Topology** defines how a network is connected together.
*   **Physical Topology:** How the cables and devices are actually wired (the layout).
*   **Logical Topology:** How the data *flows* through the network (regardless of physical look).

### Common Types
*   [[Bus and Ring Topologies]] (Legacy)
*   [[Star Topology]] (Modern Standard)
*   [[Mesh and Hybrid Topologies]] (Redundancy & Mixing)
*   [[Point-to-Point Links]] (WAN Connections)
