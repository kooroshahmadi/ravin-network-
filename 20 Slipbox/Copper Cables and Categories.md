# Copper Cables and Categories

Copper uses electrical signals to transmit data.
![[Copper Cable Types.webp]]
### Types of Shielding
*   **UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair):** Most common. Cheap, flexible. Relies on the "twist" of the wires to cancel out interference (Crosstalk).
*   **STP (Shielded Twisted Pair):** Has a foil wrap around wires. Expensive, stiff. Used in factories or areas with high EMI (Electromagnetic Interference).
*   **Coaxial:** Older. Uses a central conductor and heavy shielding. Used for Cable Modems (DOCSIS).

### Ethernet Cable Categories (Speed & Distance)
| Category | Max Speed | Max Distance | Frequency | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cat 5e** | 1 Gbps | 100 meters | 100 MHz | Standard for years. |
| **Cat 6** | 10 Gbps | 55 meters | 250 MHz | 10Gbps only short range. |
| **Cat 6a** | 10 Gbps | 100 meters | 500 MHz | The "Augmented" standard for full distance. |
| **Cat 8** | 40 Gbps | 30 meters | 2000 MHz | Data Center usage only. |

### Fire Ratings (Safety)
*   **PVC (Riser):** Standard cable jacket. Toxic when it burns. cheap.
*   **Plenum:** Special fire-retardant jacket. **MUST** be used when running cables in air ducts or drop ceilings (the "Plenum" space). It produces less smoke/fumes.
