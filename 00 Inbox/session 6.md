overview of TCP/IP Model:  
definition: a conceptual model for standardizing network communications, consisting of 4 or 5 layers.  
difference form OSI model: TCP/IP has four layers (some sources consider it a five-layer model), whereas OSI has seven layers.  
main purpose of TCP/IP ensuring stable communication, routing data, and reliable transmission of information between networked devices.  
layers of the TCP/IP model:  
network interface (physical & data link) - physical connection and frame transmission  
internet (network layer) - routing and packet transmission.  
transport - managing data transfer  
application = providing network services to application.

network interface layer in the tcp/IP model:  
definition: the lowest layer in the tcp/IP model, responsible for establishing physical connections between devices and transmitting data over the network.  
functions:  
converts digital data into electrical, optical, or wireless signals for transmission.  
manages physical addresses (MAC address) for local network communication (LAN).  
detects and corrects physical transmission error.  
key components:  
network hardware: includes cables, routers, switches, network interface cards (NIC's), and Wi-Fi antennas.  
important protocols:  
Ethernet" standard protocol for wired LAN networks.  
WiFi: wireless communication for local networks.  
ARP (address resolution protocol).  
PPP (point to point protocol): enables direct communication between two devices.

Internet layer in the TCP/IP model:  
definition: the internet layer is responsible for routing and transferring IP packets between different networks.  
functions:  
routing: determines the best path for data packets to travel from the source to the destination across various networks.  
packet forwarding: handles the transmission of packets from one network to another, ensuring the data reaches its intended destination.  
key protocols:  
IP (internet protocol): the core protocol of the he internet layer, responsible for addressing and routing packets (IPV4 & IPV6).  
ICMP (internet control message protocol): used for error reporting and diagnostic functions (e.g., ping).  
BGP (border gateway protocol): the protocol used for routing between different networks, specifically for determining the best paths on the internet.
