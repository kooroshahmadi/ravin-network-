DoS attack:
this type of attack is bascially one specific server sends a lot of requests to ours and our server will collaps under the sheer amount of requests.

DDoS attack:
DoS attack but a shit ton of servers send request to our server so we have way more requests (bad time for us) and we have to black a shit ton of servers (more bad time for us).

Rouge Access Point:
when a device is up on our network and is not configed correctly, some other device can role play as that specific device and do what ever the fuck the original could do and more. for example listening and survailence.

Man in the Middle:
in this scenario someone physically or virtually will penetrate a network and install a software or a device that sits between two devices (for example a client and a server) and then that perform survailence.
