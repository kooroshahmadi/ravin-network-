this type of attack is bascially one specific server sends a lot of requests to ours and our server will collaps under the sheer amount of requests.

DoS attack but a shit ton of servers send request to our server so we have way more requests (bad time for us) and we have to black a shit ton of servers (more bad time for us).

when a device is up on our network and is not configed correctly, some other device can role play as that specific device and do what ever the fuck
