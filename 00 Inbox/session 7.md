transport layer in the TCP/IP Model:  
definition: the transport layer is responsible for the reliable or efficient transfer of data between devices over the network.  
functions:  
reliable data transfer: ensures that data is delivered accurately and in order, and handles re-transmissions in case of loss  
flow control: manages that rate of data transmission to prevent network congestion.  
error checking: verifies the integrity of the transmitted data and requests re transmission if error are detected.  
key protocols:  
TCP (transmission control protocol): a connection-oriented, reliable protocol that guarantees data delivery and ensures error-free transmission. it establishes a connection between sender and receiver before data transfer (e.g., HTTP, FTP).  
UDP (user data-gram protocol): a connection-less, faster protocol that doesn't guarantee delivery or error-checking, typically used for real-time applications like video streaming or VoIP.

application layer in the TCP/IP Model:  
definition: the application layer is the top layer in the TCP/IP model and is responsible for providing network services directly to user application.  
functions:  
application services: provides protocols and services for software applications to communicate over the network (e.g., browsing the web, sending emails).  
interface between user and network: acts as an interface between the application programs and the network, enabling data exchange.  
key protocols:  
HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol): the protocol used for transferring web pages and resources over the internet.  
IMAP (internet message access protocol) & POP3 (post office protocol): used for retrieving email from servers.
